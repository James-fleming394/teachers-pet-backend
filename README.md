# Description
Teacher's Pet is a CRUD application that allows teacher's to view, input, update and delete any ideas that come to their mind about their teaching goals and strategies.  As a former educator, I always found myself wishing for an online notebook to store my ideas so I could come back to them later.  I wished I could share these ideas with other teachers and get their feedback.  This web application will serve this desire.  Welcome to Teacher's Pet.
